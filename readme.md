Python wrapper for Cpanel/WHM API

You can import this as a module into another application or program.

ex:

import pycpanel

pycpanel.API_KEY = 'api key here'
pycpanel.HOSTNAME = 'your hostname here' (host name for your whm configuration)
pycpanel.SESSION = 'cpess86367' (Login to whm and get any random session to put here)


Will be adding all of the other functions and methods, with a bit better organization soon.
